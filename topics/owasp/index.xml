In order to facilitate this we are organising a number of demonstrations of tools, each 30 minutes long.
What Tool 1: Threat dragon. OWASP Threat Dragon is a tool used to create threat model diagrams and to record possible threats and decide on their mitigations.
TD is both an online threat modelling web application and a desktop application.</description></item><item><title>MultiJuicer Introduction</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-1/owasp-projects/multijuicer-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-1/owasp-projects/multijuicer-introduction/</guid><description>About this talk OWASP Juice Shop is an incredible tool to learn and teach about web application security. The Juice Shop lets people attack a real(ish) web application - which looks like a normal eCommerce Shop - and learn step by step about some of the most impactful vulnerabilities.
When you are running a Security Training for developers based on the Juice Shop you have one problem: How can every developer run and access his own Juice Shop Instance to train his skills?</description></item><item><title>OSS user stories for all ASVS requirements that people can download and use</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/owasp-asvs/oss-user-stories-for-all-asvs-requirements-that-people-can-download-and-use/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/owasp-asvs/oss-user-stories-for-all-asvs-requirements-that-people-can-download-and-use/</guid><description>Session Outcomes</description></item><item><title>OWASP Juice Shop Cocktail Party - Ask us anything ( AUA )</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/owasp-juiceshop/owasp-juiceshop-cocktail-party-ask-us-anything/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/owasp-juiceshop/owasp-juiceshop-cocktail-party-ask-us-anything/</guid><description>This social session combines BYOC with AUA!

I&amp;rsquo;m asking this because sometimes, due to lack of time all I want is to spin a juice shop container and test/train a particular vulnerability.</description></item><item><title>OWASP Juice Shop introduction</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-1/owasp-projects/owasp-juiceshop-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-1/owasp-projects/owasp-juiceshop-introduction/</guid><description>In this introduction session to OWASP Juice Shop
we will take a quick tour through the OWASP flagship project that claims to be &amp;ldquo;probably the most sophisticated vulnerable web application!&amp;rdquo;
Starting with a &amp;ldquo;happy path&amp;rdquo; shopping tour we will then learn what security flaws lurk beneath the shiny web UI surface!
You will also learn about the CTF support, hacking instructor scripts, tutorial mode, dos and don&amp;rsquo;ts and some technical background of the project!</description></item><item><title>OWASP Projects</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/owasp-projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/owasp-projects/</guid><description>Sessions on multiple OWASP Projects</description></item><item><title>What OWASP tools/projects we already have and what are we missing to deliver secure devops pipelines</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/owasp-asvs/owasp-tools-projects-we-already-have/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/owasp-asvs/owasp-tools-projects-we-already-have/</guid><description>Notable logs from the chat during the session 16:19:55 From Francesco Cipollone : Owen from OWASP did some benchmarking for us 16:20:08 From Francesco Cipollone : if you reach out to grant Ongers he might be able to share
