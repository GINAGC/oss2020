"content_plain" : "Why Every company has their own third party due diligence method. Mostly a mix of questionnaires, open source investigations, sometimes onsite assessments. This is not efficient in today\u0026rsquo;s world as poor vendors are forced to spend 100s of hours each year filling in questionniares with same or similar questions over and over again. It’s not efficient for every outfit to ask their own Qs that are very similar. But CISOs are reluctant to trust BitSight/RiskLedger/other 3rd party compliance snapshots. So, how do we do dynamic assurance in a collective manner?\nWhat Last year, we said we should have a restricted opensource platform where the members would agree on a framework and scoring system for third party due diligence from cyber perspective. (later may be expanded in other compliance areas too) We later found out there are a few commercial platforms like OneTrust Vendorpedia / RiskLedger / IHS Markit KY3P and this year we will continue the discussion on CISOs view on these and potential limitations they are facing.\nThings to consider:\n[These are from last year] Are we assessing the corporate controls of the vendor or their solution\u0026rsquo;s security, or both? What framework or frameworks best suited for this? MITRE, NIST, ISO?? Scores on maturity, flags on category of information classification that is recommended to be shared with the vendor (i.e. do not share non-public information with this vendor until they remediate findigns A, B, C) Funding for the activites - should we form a consortium like what FS-ISAC does for threat intelligence? If the third party is critical outsourcing partner, would the standard evaluation be sufficient, or should there be additional things to consider.\nOutcomes Watch this space.\nWho In last ten years, every job I had included third party assurance work and I kept sending similar questionnaires to same vendors over and over. This needs to be improved and in this era of open sourcing everything, we can do better.\n",

Pretty cool, heh?\nObjectives This session had three objectives:\n Borrow UX concept of personas for a structured and reusable way to consider and discuss threats Create some Threat Personas! Explore a fast, developer-friendly way to use them and prioritise vulnerabilities Outcomes The outcomes from this session are:\n An example set of Threat Personas created by participants that teams can use and build on in their own organisations A proposed Application Vulnerability Scoring Framework for rapidly prioritising application vulnerabilities in a developer-friendly way These are being made available under open-source licences and contributions are very welcome! You can find the content in the following GitHub repositories:\n Threat Personas App Vuln Prioritisation Framework Synopsis and Takeaways Threat personas provide a way to establish a common understanding and language between infosec, technology and business teams. Their narrative-driven approach paints a rich picture that is easy for anyone to understand. They fit between high-level labels (like cyber-criminal) and specific threat actor groups (like Tangerine Flamingo).\nApp vuln scoring builds on the concept of threat personas and provides a structured, developer-friendly way to prioritise application vulnerabilities.\nIdentified Questions The numbers produced in the app vuln scoring model seem unexpected low, can these be tweaked? Can this be combined with other gamification efforts in other OWASP projects? Can we add consequence characteristics to the app vuln scoring model?

"content_plain" : "There will be two short presentations, one by Manuel Pais and another one by Mario Platt, followed by a discussion with everyone on the topics presented.\nManuel: The ratio of developers to security is 1:100 or worse, according to multiple surveys. DevSecOps has raised the profile of security in IT but we still see a regular stream of serious data breaches exposing large security gaps in many organizations.\nYou might have heard a lot about shift left security, automated security testing in the delivery pipeline, container image scanning, and so on. These are all valuable techniques but… are we forgetting the power of collaboration, facilitation, and shared responsibilities?\nBy re-thinking our team structures and how they interact with security teams we can find effective, team-oriented ways to beat the negative effects of that 1:100 ratio. This is what we did with DevOps, right? The DevOps topologies catalog compared and contrast different team organization models to enable sharing of knowledge and responsibilities between dev and ops.\nWe need to do the same for DevSecOps and in this talk I will present a few possible approaches to bridge this painful security gap. These are conversation starters and not an end in themselves. Let’s discuss the pros and cons, and in which contexts different approaches are suitable.\nMario: In Security teams, we tend to adopt a static approach to team creation leading to all sorts of problems relating to org chart thinking and impact of Conway\u0026rsquo;s law. Using Team Topologies, we can start being more deliberate in how we organise our security teams and also how we interact with other teams in the organisation.\nThis section is an exploratory exercise where we\u0026rsquo;ll all be participating, in applying Team Topologies concepts to the organisation of Cyber Security teams so we can document and share it with the community.\n",
