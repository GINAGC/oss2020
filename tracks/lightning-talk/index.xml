This talk will look at how security inevitably decreases a businesses speed and agility,
and how a tech startup prioritises security (an inevitable cost) against the speed and agility required to build a high growth business.
Finally, the talk will look at how security can be used as a differentiator to win business, and how presenting your security posture to client security is a negotiation, not a pass/fail audit.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Talk - The Future of CNI</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/lightning-talk/the-future-of-cni/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/lightning-talk/the-future-of-cni/</guid><description>About this talk A lightning tour of the G20 Digital Economy plan that utilises Smart Cities as a CNI delivery model.
