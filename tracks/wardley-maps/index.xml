The map contains a value chain — capabilities necessary to fulfill the needs, arranged according to their dependency relationships.
By attending this sessions, you will learn more details on the landscape and corresponding trends assessment, the position of the capabilities on the Wardley map and more information related to the topic.</description></item><item><title>Mapping culture</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/mapping-culture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/mapping-culture/</guid><description>About this talk: Wardley Mapping is a straight-forward process, and most difficulties boil down to concerns about making “mistakes” or doing the “wrong” thing. It is much more valuable to discard these concerns up-front, embrace the messiness of the process, and learn by boldly doing. The process of mapping is also the process of constructing a model of reality. An incorrect model that is also useful is the definition of success.</description></item><item><title>Risk Mapping - Applying Risk overlay with maps and security decision making</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/risk-overlay-with-maps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/risk-overlay-with-maps/</guid><description>About this talk: The more data penetrates into various industries, the more security threats and risks appear and it becomes really essential to deal with those risks and make the most optimal decisions.
In this session we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how Wardley maps can be applied to improve the decision making process.</description></item><item><title>Security implications of the isolation and terrorism</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/security-implications-isolation-and-terrorism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/security-implications-isolation-and-terrorism/</guid><description>About this talk: We live in an age where data has penetrated into all areas of our lives, where everything gets captured digitally. Data helps companies and businesses grow, expand and improve their products and services, constantly apply innovations, better serve their customers and gain new ones.
While more and more companies gather data and share, store and access various files, it becomes vital to analyze files, prevent or spot unknown threats and struggle with malicious content, successfully manage incidents.</description></item><item><title>Strategy Development - applying the concepts (Wardley Maps)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/strategy-development-applying-the-concepts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/strategy-development-applying-the-concepts/</guid><description>About this talk: In this talk we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss 4 Problems for Cyber Security for the next Decade using Doctrine and Climatic patterns as the basis to discuss and develop potential solutions for it.
The Communications problem The Management problem The Engineering problem The Skills and Structure problem We will then break out into groups, to continue discussion on these and/or other problems and use Climatic Patterns and Doctrine to discuss and propose solutions for them.</description></item><item><title>Team Topologies &amp; PST &amp; Squads &amp; Tribes</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/team-topologies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/team-topologies/</guid><description>During this Session we&amp;rsquo;ll explore combing the principles of: Wardley Maps ; Pioneers, Settlers and Town Planners Squads and Tribes Team Topologies In an attempt to explore effective organisational structure that aligns effectively with the systems being built.
Why Team designs are very important because good team designs lead to good software design and good software design leads to better more effective teams (or if you get it wrong the cycle goes the other way).</description></item><item><title>Threat Mapping (using Maps in Cyber Security)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/threat-mapping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/threat-mapping/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wardley Mapping - content from last Summit</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/content/sessions-last-summit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/content/sessions-last-summit/</guid><description>Sessions focusing on the use of Wardley Maps in Security.
