Manuel: The ratio of developers to security is 1:100 or worse, according to multiple surveys. DevSecOps has raised the profile of security in IT but we still see a regular stream of serious data breaches exposing large security gaps in many organizations.
You might have heard a lot about shift left security, automated security testing in the delivery pipeline, container image scanning, and so on.</description></item><item><title>Ben Schofield</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/ben-schofield/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/ben-schofield/</guid><description>Ben Schofield is a Digital Media Consultant focused on media logistics and metadata, and content security.</description></item><item><title>Bjoern Kimminich</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/bjoern-kimminich/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/bjoern-kimminich/</guid><description> Product Group Lead Architecture Governance + Application Security at Kuehne + Nagel Lecturer for IT Security at University of Applied Sciences NORDAKADEMIE OWASP Juice Shop Project Leader</description></item><item><title>Black Lives Matter</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/black-lives-matter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/black-lives-matter/</guid><description>Black Lives MATTER https://blacklivesmatter.com/

Combined with the power of Jupyter notebooks, we have stunning new ways to organize and visualize our data. Utlizing Jira’s API, secure authentication ensures that data doesn’t get into the wrong hands, and all the same flexible privilege options that we set in Jira will apply in Jupyter.</description></item><item><title>Joshua Jebaraj</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/joshua-jebaraj/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/joshua-jebaraj/</guid><description>Joshua Jebaraj is undergrad Student Currently pursuing his undergrad at Vellore Institute of technology Chennai He is active memeber of many open-source communties like null , Ansible and Hashicorp He frequently speaks at null chennai chapter and owasp Vit chennai

This talk will look at how security inevitably decreases a businesses speed and agility,
and how a tech startup prioritises security (an inevitable cost) against the speed and agility required to build a high growth business.
Finally, the talk will look at how security can be used as a differentiator to win business, and how presenting your security posture to client security is a negotiation, not a pass/fail audit.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Talk - The Future of CNI</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/lightning-talk/the-future-of-cni/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/lightning-talk/the-future-of-cni/</guid><description>About this talk A lightning tour of the G20 Digital Economy plan that utilises Smart Cities as a CNI delivery model.

It is much more valuable to discard these concerns up-front, embrace the messiness of the process, and learn by boldly doing. The process of mapping is also the process of constructing a model of reality. An incorrect model that is also useful is the definition of success.</description></item><item><title>Mario Platt</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/mario-platt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/mario-platt/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mark Carney</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/mark-carney/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/mark-carney/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mark Miller</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/mark-miller/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/mark-miller/</guid><description>Director of Programme, Public Finance at ODI</description></item><item><title>Martin Brian</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/martin-brian/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/martin-brian/</guid><description>I develop and implement software using mainly C, C++, and Python.

This can be found at https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/pattern-safely-importing-data
The pattern fundamentally recommends a Transform and Verify approach to imports as shown below:
This has some significant differences to import processes typically in use in commercial environments.
The objective of this session is to raise the awareness of this pattern, highlight the differences in the pattern and the pros/cons of them, and to explore the practicalities of using this patter in commercial environments.</description></item><item><title>Nicholas Bloom</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/glasswall/nicholas-bloom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/glasswall/nicholas-bloom/</guid><description>Nicholas is the Senior Vice President EMEA at Glasswall</description></item><item><title>O365 Security - Anti-Phishing best practises and Demo</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/hacking-and-defending/o365-security-anti-phishing-best-practises-and-demo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/hacking-and-defending/o365-security-anti-phishing-best-practises-and-demo/</guid><description>Training Session Video</description></item><item><title>Office Documents ISG - How to automate Inspection and Sanitization Guidance testing</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-office-docs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-office-docs/</guid><description>Training Session Video About this talk: Once learning about the potential areas of concern that exist within office documents and exploring ISGs for them, it&amp;rsquo;s now time to discover the testing strategies that will be oriented on validation of the requirements of the ISGs.

Creating something simple is very difficult (&amp;hellip;)
Overthinking/Over-engineering How do you define it? Does one follow another? Where does OT/OE end and becomes a requirement? Can OT/OE be a side-effect caused by something else? i.e. Lack of experience. i.e. would you still choose starting with micro-services or plan for a may-not-be-needed distributed structure. Lack of visibility on business goals, projects etc Not able to keep up with ever growing buzzwords and products Not able to define and understand not-so-technical concepts like bottlenecks or constraints, so fail to see/prevent them.</description></item><item><title>OWASP Juice Shop Cocktail Party - Ask us anything ( AUA )</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/owasp-juiceshop/owasp-juiceshop-cocktail-party-ask-us-anything/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/owasp-juiceshop/owasp-juiceshop-cocktail-party-ask-us-anything/</guid><description>This social session combines BYOC with AUA!

Data helps companies and businesses grow, expand and improve their products and services, constantly apply innovations, better serve their customers and gain new ones.
While more and more companies gather data and share, store and access various files, it becomes vital to analyze files, prevent or spot unknown threats and struggle with malicious content, successfully manage incidents.</description></item><item><title>Security Labels for Covid Apps</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/covid/security-labels-for-covid-apps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/covid/security-labels-for-covid-apps/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Security Standards of today</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/_not_happening/security-standards-of-today/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/_not_happening/security-standards-of-today/</guid><description/></item><item><title>SEMI-SOCIAL: Improv Comedy as a Social Engineering Tool</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/social/improv-comedy-as-a-social-engineering-tool/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/social/improv-comedy-as-a-social-engineering-tool/</guid><description>Training Session Video About this talk: Have you ever gotten an &amp;ldquo;urgent call about you car warranty&amp;rdquo; or a demand that &amp;ldquo;you need to pay the IRS by credit card right now&amp;rdquo;? Social Engineering is the practice of talking your way into or out of situations, and is often employed by the underhanded, but can also be used to defend against those very attacks.
The rules of improv comedy can apply to many social interactions, including bluffing your way to compromise a target.</description></item><item><title>Sense making with Cynefin framework</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/miscellaneous/sense-making-with-cynefin-framework/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/miscellaneous/sense-making-with-cynefin-framework/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Session not found</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/faq/help/session-not-found/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/faq/help/session-not-found/</guid><description>If you see a red link like this (when you map a working or user session):

In such attacks, the victim is not the ultimate target of the attack, but rather a stepping stone to other larger networks. In this talk, I will present an overview of enterprise cyber risk and supply chain attacks and delve into various attack patterns, specific cases, lessons learned, challenges and mitigations.</description></item><item><title>Team Topologies &amp; Compliance as code</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-1/misc/team-topologies-compliance-as-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-1/misc/team-topologies-compliance-as-code/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Team Topologies &amp; PST &amp; Squads &amp; Tribes</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/team-topologies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/team-topologies/</guid><description>During this Session we&amp;rsquo;ll explore combing the principles of: Wardley Maps ; Pioneers, Settlers and Town Planners Squads and Tribes Team Topologies In an attempt to explore effective organisational structure that aligns effectively with the systems being built.
Why Team designs are very important because good team designs lead to good software design and good software design leads to better more effective teams (or if you get it wrong the cycle goes the other way).</description></item><item><title>The Previous Summit (OWASP Summit 2017)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/about2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/about2019/</guid><description>The Summit venue at Woburn Forest has great surroundings

Mostly a mix of questionnaires, open source investigations, sometimes onsite assessments. This is not efficient in today&amp;rsquo;s world as poor vendors are forced to spend 100s of hours each year filling in questionniares with same or similar questions over and over again. It’s not efficient for every outfit to ask their own Qs that are very similar. But CISOs are reluctant to trust BitSight/RiskLedger/other 3rd party compliance snapshots.</description></item><item><title>Threat Mapping (using Maps in Cyber Security)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/threat-mapping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/working-sessions/threat-mapping/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Threat model academic research status</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-modeling/threat-model-academic-research-status/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-modeling/threat-model-academic-research-status/</guid><description>Why The industry and the academic environments do not often talk to each other.

What Kim will go into LINDDUN GO (https://www.linddun.org/go) as a way to look into privacy related threats. She will also discuss how to use LINDDUN GO and will be asking for feedback from the community.

Components are drawn as nodes on a graph with value on the y-axis and commodity on the x-axis. A custom-made component with no direct value to the user would sit at the bottom-left of such a graph while a commodity component with high direct value to the user would sit at the top-right of such a graph.</description></item><item><title>Wardley Mapping resources</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/content/wardley-maps-resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/content/wardley-maps-resources/</guid><description>Atlas 2 - https://atlas2.wardleymaps.com/ You can login with a Google account or create one, and start mapping right away.

It&amp;rsquo;s is a map of the structure of a business or service, mapping the components needed to serve the customer or the user. Wardley maps are named after Simon Wardley who created them in 2005. By attending this session, you will have an exceptional chance to get some basic knowledge on Wardley mapping, learn about its main pillars, get ideas for its practical usage and explore your most important questions directly with Simon Wardley and other participants.</description></item><item><title>What are ISGs and how to convert ISGs into checklists?</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-converting-to-checklist/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-converting-to-checklist/</guid><description>About this talk: We live in an age where data has penetrated into all areas of our lives, where everything gets captured digitally. Data helps companies and businesses grow, expand and improve their products and services, constantly apply innovations, better serve their customers and gain new ones.
While more and more companies gather data and share, store and access various files, it becomes vital to analyze files, spot unknown threats and struggle with malicious content.</description></item><item><title>What can be leveraged from what we already have to move from devops to devsecops + What is missing + What will be priority</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/_not_happening/what-can-be-leveraged-from-what-we-already-have-to-move-from-devops-to-devsecops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/_not_happening/what-can-be-leveraged-from-what-we-already-have-to-move-from-devops-to-devsecops/</guid><description>Enable practitioners to (&amp;hellip;)
