In such attacks, the victim is not the ultimate target of the attack, but rather a stepping stone to other larger networks. In this talk, I will present an overview of enterprise cyber risk and supply chain attacks and delve into various attack patterns, specific cases, lessons learned, challenges and mitigations.</description></item><item><title>Team Topologies &amp; Compliance as code</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-1/misc/team-topologies-compliance-as-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-1/misc/team-topologies-compliance-as-code/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Threat Modeling - Cloud Functions as Detonation Chambers</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-cloud-detonation-chambers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-cloud-detonation-chambers/</guid><description>About this talk: In this session, we&amp;rsquo;ll do threat modelling for using a cloud funtion as a detonation chamber. A detonation chamber as defined by NIST, is an ideal capability for providing vulnerability shielding. They allow for a thorough analysis of objects entering an environment to determine if they are malicious or contain exploit code targeting a known vulnerability or an unknown/zero-day vulnerability.</description></item><item><title>Threat Modeling - Cloud Functions as Detonation Chambers - Part 1</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-1/hacking-and-defending/hacking-glasswall-sdk-and-cloud-thursday/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-1/hacking-and-defending/hacking-glasswall-sdk-and-cloud-thursday/</guid><description>Training Session Video</description></item><item><title>Threat Modeling - ICAP</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-icap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-icap/</guid><description>About this talk: In this session, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive into the Internet Content Adaption Protocol (ICAP). The protocol is used to extend proxy servers and investigation is ongoing on how to integrate CDR technology with Proxy companies like F5 through ICAP to allow safe transfer of documents accross domains. We&amp;rsquo;ll be doing a threat model to better undertand potential vulnerabilities.

Data helps companies and businesses grow, expand and improve their products and services, constantly apply innovations, better serve their customers and gain new ones.
While more and more companies gather data and share, store and access various files, it becomes vital to analyze files, spot unknown threats and struggle with malicious content.</description></item><item><title>What security exploits are prevented by implementing ISGs</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-security-expoit-protection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-security-expoit-protection/</guid><description>Training Session Video About this talk: Cyber attackers want access to the user&amp;rsquo;s sensitive information or intellectual property for strategic advantage, or more commonly, for monetary gain. They commonly attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the user&amp;rsquo;s computer system and network by using malware delivered via email or web servers.
This session will be dedicated to a discussion of the security exploits that can be prevented by applying ISGs.</description></item><item><title>Zero Trust Architecture</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-1/devsecops/zero-trust-architecture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/training/week-1/devsecops/zero-trust-architecture/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
